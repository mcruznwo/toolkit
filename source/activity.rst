Activity
========

This section describes the main interactive activity during the workshop, with
step-by-step instructions.


Guided break-out group discussion
---------------------------------

.. attention::

   Ask the participants to form break-out groups and work on the given
   scenario.

.. hint::

   Set a timer of 10 minutes for discussing each question.

Ideal world
^^^^^^^^^^^

To facilitate the discussions during the breakout session, we asked the
participants first to imagine that they are in the *ideal world situation*.
They can build the ideal team they need for the task by not thinking about any
limitations (e.g. budget, etc.). The breakout groups were given two questions:

* **What are the important aspects in this project?**

  With this question, we asked participants to discuss things they, as a team,
  need to manage regarding societal impact, scientific impact, open science,
  publicity, economic gains and other related aspects, and try to make the list
  as concrete as possible.

* **What skills / roles are needed to address these aspects?**

  Based on the aspects identified in the previous question, the participants
  need to make a list of relevant skills and/or roles per aspect. They are free
  to draw many-to-many connections between the aspects and the skills/roles,
  if possible.

Reality
^^^^^^^

Then we invited the participants to bring the ideal situation discussed back to
the reality and asked them the following two questions:

* **Do people with those skills / roles exist? Do you know where to find them?**

  The participants were encouraged to think about their own situation, e.g.
  for a certain skill/role identified, do people know if it exists in their
  institution, do people know how to approach those groups, etc.

* **Can you successfully include them in the project? How?**

  If you find the skills/roles in your institution, what are the conditions of
  including them in the research project.


Reporting
---------

After the guided break-out group discussion, we asked the rapporteurs from
each group to give a brief summary of their discussion, followed by a short
reflection on how the breakout session went.


Plenary discussion
------------------

The workshop was wrapped up with a plenary session, which was focused on
practical implications of the discussion. Here we would like the participants
to think about practical tips or creative ideas that they can use immediately
in their work.

Instead of open discussion, it is also recommended to run an online survey
(e.g. Mentimeter) at the end of the workshop, some exemplary questions could
be:

* What can you do today to address the challenges?
* What can your organisation do today?
* What is the most important take-away from the workshop for you?
* What actions can you take today that make your own work environment more
  inclusive and appreciative?
